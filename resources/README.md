##Resources

This folder, `resources/`, is meant to contain all resources necessary for running the workflow. 
- The `cluster.yaml` file can make specific resource requests to biowulf via slurm.
- The `index.yaml` file points to the paths of all Bowtie2 index files (already built).
- The `tools.yaml` file contains the version numbers of all relevent tools used within the pipeline.
